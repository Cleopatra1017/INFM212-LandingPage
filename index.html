			<h2>The Websites I Like</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>1:<a href="https://getmimo.com/" target ="_blank">MIMO</a>
					<p>-I am still pretty new to the world of web development so I use MIMO to help me practice.
					In addition, to it being a very well made website, the method of teaching that they utilize is through
					gaming and this makes it very unique and helpful.
				  So I definitley recommend it to anybody that is looking for a creative and interactive way to practice programing.</p>
				<li>2:<a href="https://chipotle.com/order/sign-in" target ="_blank">Chipotle</a>
					<p>-As most of you may already know, Chipotle is a restaurant. Personally, it is one of my very favorites.
						Especially in regards to the website, everything is so easily accessible, and it features a nutrition calculator, rewards,
						catering, and a few other essentials.</p>
				<li>3:<a href="https://www.zara.com/us/" target ="_blank">ZARA</a>
					<p>-I've always viewed ZARA as one of those clothing lines that play a perfect intermediate role between luxury and affordable fashion.
						Their clothing is nothing short of exemplary, and the same goes for their website.
						Their site has a simple yet classic tone that delivers a great experience for the user.</p>
			</ul>

			<h2>The Websites I Do Not Like</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>1:<a href="http://www2.pnwx.com/" target ="_blank">Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</a>
					<p>-Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc is a company that specializes in equipment, accessories, supplies, and parts for x-ray systems.
						Even though their company seems to have great resources, their website is quite unprofessional and sketchy to say the least.</p>
				<li>2:<a href="http://arngren.net/" target ="_blank">Arngren</a>
					<p>-Arngren is a European website that specializes in selling electronics. Even though some of the technology featured on the website is
						normal, the majority of it seems a bit absurd. With that being said they claim to sell submarines, rocket ships, helicopters,
						robots, "sky cars,"  hover pods, and many more. Additionally, I noticed that some of their flying vehicles had wires attached to them at
						the top to help them float. Lastly, I must admit the technology sold at Arngren reminded me of the movie <em>Back To The Future</em>
						because of all the "futuristic" gadgets and gizmos that they claim to have for sale. Please press the link to see for yourself.<br/></p>
				<li>3:<a href="http://www.007museum.com/" target ="_blank">007 Museum</a>
					<p>-The website created for 007 Museum was a little off, to be honest. Although, after thoroughly reviewing everything, I noticed that they
						 have a lot of great content. Which includes multiple videos, photos, and links to various websites. However, everything the content
						 was unorganized which made it difficult for me to understand what was happening. </p>
